If Marx at twenty-two had a problem, it was that he was attracted to too many things and people.  Marx's favorite adjective was <strong>"interesting."</strong>  The world seemed filled with interesting games to play, interesting food to taste, and interesting people to have sex with and sometimes even to fall in love with.

Who wouldn't want a pineapple smoothie, a roast pork bun, an omelet, pickled vegetables, sushi, and a green-tea-flavored croissant?  They were all there for the taking and delicious, in their own way.
